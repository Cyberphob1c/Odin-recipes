This is a regular md file that will serve as a description for my first project

Part of the Odin course, i will be making a website for recipes. This will demonstrate various basic HTML skills including creating and laying out the barebones of a Html file such as making basic headers, paragraphs, lists, adding images, embedding links, alt texts and basic stylization without CSS.

This will also serve as practice in using GIT, comitting and writing messages therein

Any lines beyond this will be updated post-project with additional information if necessary
